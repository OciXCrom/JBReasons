# JailBreak-Reasons
Since there is no approved version of this plugin in AlliedMods, I decided to make one and post it here. This plugin is meant for JailBreak servers, as stated in the title. When a guard kills a prisoner, the plugin opens up a menu for the guard from which he needs to choose a reason for killing that prisoner. You can set and edit the kill reasons fast and easy, by opening the configuration file. This version of the plugin contains some additional options. The first one is entering a custom reason by pressing the button "t" (spray), and the other one is "denying" the kill with the button "n" (nightvision), which can automatically revive the prisoner if the cvar is enabled.
